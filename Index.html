			<h2> About me: </h2>
						<p> I am a junior pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at Stony Brook University. My interest
						in mathematics has led me to contemplate pursuing a masters in Applied Math particularly in Data Analysis.
						I am also interested in studying more about machine learning and networks and would love to partake in research in either areas.
						What primarily led me to pursue Computer Science is its capacity for connecting people from virtually any part of the world and
					 create something that could benefit on global scale. My first experience with programming was also a positive one and I became eager
				 to further my understanding and skills.</p>
					 <p> I try to keep my life outside of academics diverse. Nonetheless, I have a few hobbies that I enjoy immensely including reading,
					 gaming, watching movies and shows, basketball (both watching and playing), and chess. I am avid listener to Rock music mainly, but appreciate talent in any
				 genre. </p>
