         		<h1 style="text-align: center;"> About me </h1>
				<p class="description"> I am from Yonkers, New York. I graduated from Stony Brook University in May 2019 with a double major in Computer Science, and Applied Mathematics and Statistics. My interests as a software engineer span various domains including backend and systems development. The three languages I am most proficient in are Python, Java, and C, in that order. Other languages I have experience with include: JavaScript, PHP, SQL, and C++. </p>
        		<p class="description"> I discovered my passion for programming the summer of 2016 when I took CSE101 (Python programming) with Professor Kevin McDonnell. Since then, I have continued to hone my skills and add to my technical repertoire through coursework and personal projects. </p>
        		<p class="description"> I believe I possess many attributes that would make me a valuable member of any team. However, there are three main ones I would like to highlight: </p> <ul> <li> I am a <b> listener</b> ; I welcome constructive criticism and see it as an opportunity for improvement. I think any software developer in my position can benefit from being a keen listener.  </li> <li> I am <b> persistent </b>; I can rack my head against a hard problem for long periods of time. Tackling complex problems is both fun and rewarding, especially when they have significant implications for the people who use the solution. </li> <li> I am <b> emotionally intelligent</b>. Oftentimes working in teams can become tense, and this skill makes me well-equipped to perform well even when such situations arise. I can manage my emotions and deal with other's emotions well, which can mean much when work stress starts hitting hard. </li> </ul> 
        		<p class="description"> I am currently in search of entry-level software engineer/web developer/software developer opportunities, so if you're looking for an awesome developer and team-player, don't hesitate to reach out!</p>
